                                5-minutes. Think about how you would start thinking about testing what is represented in
                                the diagram
                                above. Then read the article in the source to check your understanding. Why is being

                                abstraction also. As testers, we seem to be good at participating in highly detailed

                                discussions. But we should try to participate in imagining the evolution of the product
                                and the
                                architectural trade-offs being made. If
